        <h1>Girls Who Code: Who ARE we?</h1>
        <p>According to computerscience.org, "only 20% of computer science professionals are women." Not only this, but the amount of women pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science has <b>decreased</b> since 1970. WHAT?! Even with more and more technology being available, the computer science field and the STEM field in general, is lacking in terms of female representation. So what can we do?  </p>
        <p>To combat this issue, we started at the root of the problem: awareness and opportunity. We all know that when beginning a new path or starting to learn something new, complications are inevitable. Especially with a topic as complex as computer science, it is bewildering to know where to begin. For this reason, we decided to take the opportunity to create a safe community in which anyone, no matter their experience in computer science, was allowed to join and grow both as a programmer and an individual! </p>
	<p>Based in Rocklin High School, our club has grown to __ people in just __ years! From learning Python to participating in HPE CodeWars to learning to code our very own club website, we have had the honor of working with some of the kindest people that we've ever met. </p>
	<p>Thank you so much to Mr. Werner and Mr. Clarion for inspiring us to expand our knowledge outside of the computer science classroom and into larger clubs and communities. And thank you so much to Mr. McAdams for teaching us everything we know.
