Put your name and year of graduation here!
*Melody Gill, Class of 2021
*Emily Broad, Class of 2022
*Sierra Janson, Class of 2023: 5/29/2022 fixed typo, gave fixed text spacing (more centered), added styling to header
*2023-08-30, McAdams: modified home page with notice about meeting times, also changed home page image, and max width style so it isn't huge on desktops. Also changed attribute/documentation comments like these to PHP comments, so people viewing source won't see them (no need to show the internet your businessðŸ˜Ž)
